## Featured Work

- **[Streaming Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/Nasa28?tab=repositories)** — Event-driven ingestion with Go and pub/sub, built to handle millions of events per day with backpressure and observability.
- **[Deployment Accelerator](https://github.com/Nasa28?tab=repositories)** — CI/CD automation that cuts release cycles by ~75% through gated rollouts and automated quality checks.
- **[Real-time Collaboration APIs](https://github.com/Nasa28?tab=repositories)** — WebSocket/SSE services for low-latency updates, backed by Redis caching for consistent performance at scale.

## Professional Experience Highlights

### Backend Engineering
- Architected and operated microservices handling millions of requests daily (Go, NestJS, Express)
- Delivered REST/GraphQL APIs with typed contracts plus tracing, metrics, and alerting baked in
- Built event-driven pipelines with queues/pub/sub to decouple services and improve resilience
- Implemented realtime channels via WebSockets and Server-Sent Events for low-latency UX

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Containerized workloads with Docker and orchestrated on Kubernetes across AWS, GCP, and Azure
- Built CI/CD pipelines that cut deployment cycles by ~75% through automated testing and gated releases
- Tuned databases and caching (PostgreSQL, Redis) to shrink hot query latency and offload read traffic
- Added rollout/rollback safety nets and monitoring for predictable releases

### System Design & Performance
- Led monolith-to-microservices migrations with clear domain boundaries and SLOs
- Optimized critical queries and caches for ~60% performance gains on hot paths
- Scaled horizontally under high traffic with load balancing, capacity planning, and autoscaling
- Designed fault-tolerant systems with health checks, circuit breaking, monitoring, and alerting

### Technical Leadership
- Set code review standards and engineering practices to keep quality high
- Mentored engineers on system design, clean architecture, and observability-first development
- Championed TDD and automated quality gates to raise coverage and reliability
- Coordinated across product and design to deliver complex technical solutions on schedule
